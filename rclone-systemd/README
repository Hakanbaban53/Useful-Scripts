# Rclone Mount Automation Scripts

This directory contains scripts and service files to automate mounting Rclone drives based on network connectivity.

## Files

- **`rclone-mount.service`**: Systemd service for mounting Google Drive using Rclone.
- **`99-rclone-restart`**: NetworkManager dispatcher script to manage the Rclone service based on network events.

## Installation

1. **Copy the systemd service:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp rclone-mount.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

2. **Copy the dispatcher script:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp 99-rclone-restart /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/
   sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rclone-restart
   ```

3. **Service Management:**
   - You **do not need** to manually enable the `rclone-mount.service`. The `99-rclone-restart` script will automatically trigger the service on network events.

4. **View Logs:**
   - **Rclone Service Logs:**
     ```bash
     journalctl -u rclone-mount.service -f
     ```
   - **NetworkManager Dispatcher Logs (including `99-rclone-restart` events):**
     ```bash
     journalctl -u NetworkManager -f | grep 99-rclone-restart
     ```
   - **99-rclone-restart Log file:**
     ```bash
     tail -f /var/log/rclone-dispatcher.log
     ```

   This allows you to monitor both the Rclone service and the dispatcher script in real-time.

## Usage

The Rclone service will automatically start or stop based on network connectivity events. Logs are stored in `/var/log/rclone-dispatcher.log`.

## Customization

- Adjust the remote name, mount path, cache size, or log level in `rclone-mount.service`.
- Modify network stability checks in `99-rclone-restart`.

## Log Rotation (Optional but Recommended)

To prevent the log file from growing indefinitely, configure log rotation:

1. **Create a Logrotate Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/rclone-dispatcher
   ```

2. **Add the Following Configuration**:
   ```bash
   /var/log/rclone-dispatcher.log {
       daily
       missingok
       rotate 7
       compress
       delaycompress
       notifempty
       create 644 root root
   }
   ```

   This setup will:
   - Rotate logs daily.
   - Keep the last 7 logs.
   - Compress old logs.
   - Avoid rotation if the log is empty.
